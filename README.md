# 🎬 Movie Ratings Analysis – RSVP Movies (MySQL Project)

This project focuses on analyzing **IMDB-style movie ratings data** using **MySQL**. It is based on **RSVP Movies**, an Indian film production company, and aims to extract valuable insights about movie performance, user behavior, and trends using structured SQL queries.

---

## 🧠 Objective

**RSVP Movies** plans to release a new film for the global audience. Before doing so, they want to make **data-driven decisions** using their historical movie data from the last 3 years.

As a **data analyst and SQL expert**, your task is to:
- Analyze the dataset provided
- Answer business-related questions using SQL
- Generate insights and **recommendations** that will guide RSVP Movies in planning their upcoming international release

The analysis is divided into **four segments**, each focusing on different aspects of the business using various table combinations. All questions are embedded as **SQL comments** in the provided script — you must write your queries just below each question.

---

## 📁 Dataset Sources

There are two versions of the dataset:

1. **Small Dataset (SQL File)**  
   - Included in the repository.
   - Run this file to auto-generate the schema, populate data, and view analysis questions.

2. **Large Dataset (Excel File)** *(Optional)*  
   - Provided for more advanced analysis.
   - Can be imported into MySQL manually or via tools like **MySQL Workbench**, **DBeaver**, or **pandas**.

---

## 💻 SQL Server Used

- **MySQL**

⚠️ *Note:* If you're using a different SQL engine (e.g., PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server), you may experience compatibility issues due to syntax differences in string functions, date functions, and joins.

## 🔍 What You'll Find in This Project

- 📜 `rsvp_movies.sql`: SQL file with schema, data, and embedded analysis questions
- 🧠 `rsvp_movies_solution.sql`: Contains all the solution queries
- 📊 `rsvp_movies_large.xlsx`: Optional large dataset for deeper analysis
- 📄 `Summary.pdf`: (Optional) Written summary of the insights and recommendations

---

## 🧪 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Writing complex SQL queries
- Using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and subqueries
- Filtering and ranking data
- Translating business objectives into SQL logic
- Structuring a project for real-world use

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install **MySQL** and open your preferred SQL editor (MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, etc.)
2. Run the `rsvp_movies.sql` script to set up the database
3. Answer the questions by writing your queries in the script
4. Refer to the `rsvp_movies_solution.sql` if you're stuck or want to compare approaches

---

## ✅ Learning Outcome

By the end of this project, you'll be able to:
- Analyze business scenarios using SQL
- Structure your analytics into clear, logical segments
- Make data-backed recommendations based on query results
