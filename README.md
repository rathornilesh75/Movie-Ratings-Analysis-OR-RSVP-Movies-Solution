# 🎬 Movie Ratings Analysis – RSVP Movies (MySQL Project)

This project focuses on analyzing **IMDB-style movie ratings data** using **MySQL**. It is based on **RSVP Movies**, an Indian film production company, and aims to extract valuable insights about movie performance, user behavior, and trends using structured SQL queries.

---

## 🧠 Objective

**RSVP Movies** plans to release a new film for the global audience. Before doing so, they want to make **data-driven decisions** using their historical movie data from the last 3 years.

As a **data analyst and SQL expert**, your task is to:
- Analyze the dataset provided
- Answer business-related questions using SQL
- Generate insights and **recommendations** that will guide RSVP Movies in planning their upcoming international release

The analysis is divided into **four segments**, each focusing on different aspects of the business using various table combinations. All questions are embedded as **SQL comments** in the provided script — you must write your queries just below each question.

---

## 📁 Dataset Sources

There are two versions of the dataset:

1. **Small Dataset (SQL File)**  
   - Included in the repository.
   - Run this file to auto-generate the schema, populate data, and view analysis questions.

2. **Large Dataset (Excel File)** *(Optional)*  
   - Provided for more advanced analysis.
   - Can be imported into MySQL manually or via tools like **MySQL Workbench**, **DBeaver**, or **pandas**.

## 💻 SQL Server Used

- **MySQL**

⚠️ *Note:* If you're using a different SQL engine (e.g., PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server), you may experience compatibility issues due to syntax differences in string functions, date functions, and joins.
